# KWS-AC301L-power-meter-RS485-raspberry-pi-logging
This is a python script to log data from KWS-AC301L power meter

Logging data from KWS-AC301L power meter
from China stores.

This equipment is sutable for measuring household electricity consumption.
It measures AC 1 phase Voltage 50-300V, Current up to 100A with coil.

Values displayed:
V, A, (k)W, power factor, kWh, elapsed time, temperature, Hz

The *L model has RS485 interface, to read actual data from the box.

It comes with a very basic software that can be downloaded from chinese file sharing
site.

It only runs on windows

Showed graphs disappear when program closed.

No zoom functions.

Logging only a daily kWh value into an sqlite db.


I decided to change it to a more affordable raspberry PI environment.

I used CH340/CH341type USB-RS485 adapter. It worked with windows 7,10 and
also has driver for raspbian.

The serial communication must have been analized.
I used free-serial-analyzer to dump communication.

There are 9 values that can be read from the box.

You can use the attached python3 script to log data to file (csv or key-value)
Logging parameters inside the script.

Feel free to use and develop this script as you need!

Installation:

Tested on Raspberry PI 3B
with Raspbian 11	5.15.32

#update your repo
sudo apt-get update
#install pip3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
#install pyserial
sudo pip3 install pyserial
#clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/kutasg/KWS-AC301L-power-meter-RS485-raspberry-pi-logging

#Connect your CH340/CH341 USB converter
#It is working plug and play.

#check if module loaded, device exists:
lsmod |grep ch3
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0

#Modify parameters in the script if necessary
serialdev="/dev/ttyUSB0"

#Look for the log file e.g.
cat power_meter_2022-07-16.log

#if you want to run it in the background all day long,
#edit meter_launcher.sh program path
#add this line to crontab (replace path if necessary)
* * * * * /home/pi/meter_launcher.sh

#It launches KWS-AC301L_logcollect.py script every minute if it's not running.
